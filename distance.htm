<H1>Kreiotal Atum!</H1>You decide to follow the column of smoke and find its 
source. You figure that if there was anybody living in this planet, chances were 
that you were going to find him this way. After several hours of walking towards 
the smoke, you arrive at a clearing in the jungle. 
<P>You see the old ruins of a temple with a pyramid still intact in the middle. 
A the top of the pyramid, there is a sacrificial altar, with a great fire 
blazing. 
<P>A few steps closer and you realized that you had entered an interdimensional 
portal unknowingly. You look behind and sure enough, the portal back to Dagobah 
was still there. 
<P>A mighty Cimmerian warrior appeared out of nowhere and though, at first, you 
could not understand a thing he was mumbling, you realized that he had no 
intention of harming you.
