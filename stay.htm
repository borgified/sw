<BODY>
<H1>Rescue 911</H1>You sit on the trunk of a fallen tree pondering when the 
rescue team was going to arrive. Meanwhile, its nightfall and having nowhere to 
sleep and nothing to eat, you begin crying and cursing the situation that you've 
gotten into this time. Your wait was, however, in vain. Nobody... absolutely 
NOBODY knew that you were coming here and though your chances of getting rescued 
were worse than nill, you decided to just sit here and rot. By the time you had 
realized that this wasn't the way to go, it was too late. Due to your old age, 
your bones threatened to snap as you tried to stand. You try screaming for help 
and nothing but a hoarse whisper came out. You die a pitiful death, totally 
unfit for the JediKnight you once were when you first arrived.
