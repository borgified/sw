<BODY>
<H1>You Go!, Girl.</H1>You awaken from your nightmare and find yourself back in 
the farmland with Uncle Owen. You remember that you had to go with your uncle to 
buy some droids tomorrow and that you hadn't finished your homework yet. 
<P>Furthermore, you realize that you are a girl. And that you, in fact, do not 
have an uncle named Owen. Your dog, Toto, barks happily seeing you awake and you 
live out the rest of your life in many adventures in the Wonderful Land of Oz.
