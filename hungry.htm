<H1>Ouch!</H1>As you climb out of the cockpit, darkness quickly enveloped you. 
You had forgotten that it would be impossible to hunt anything when you couldn't 
even see your own hand in front of your face. You had also forgotten about the 
millions of critters and mosquitoes that had been attracted to your lighted 
cockpit. As you are being stung to death, you wished you had thought twice about 
letting all the critters get into the cockpit.
