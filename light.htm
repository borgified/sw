<H1>En guarde!</H1>Your lightsaber flickers to life as you use it's glow to 
illuminate your surroundings. It's gentle hum gives your a sense of false 
security, but your chances now, are better, nevertheless. 
<P>"Hellooo?", you shout half-heartedly. You didn't think anyone could live in 
these conditions but somehow you had the feeling that you were wrong. A low 
mourning howl reverberated the jungle just as you were about to switch off your 
lightsaber and thinking twice, you decide to leave it on, just in case.
