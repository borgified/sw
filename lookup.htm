<BODY>
<H1>You GO!, boy.</H1>As you look up, it was too late already. A massive fist 
came crushing down onto your fragile skull and instantly, you were rendered 
unconcious. During the split second before your doom, you wished you had stayed 
with Uncle Owen working in the moisture farms on Tatooine. That way, you'd never 
had to worry about the stupid droids that wandered off, nor learning all these 
stupid Jedi mind tricks, and though your stupid life would've been boring, you'd 
still be alive.
