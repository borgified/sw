<H1>Night time</H1>You awaken from your deep slumber but it is still dark 
outside. Thankfully the life support system is still functioning and you have 
managed to get the emergency lights to turn on. Unfortunately, turning on the 
lights was a bad idea. All sorts of critters, drawn by the illumination gathered 
around your ship and threatened to get inside from the vent slits. You hope that 
by daylight, they will be gone. As you try to stretch, you find that your bones 
have gotten stiff and your muscles cramped. Seeing that there were still a good 
couple of hours to go before dawn, you decide to go back to <A 
href="nextday.htm">sleep</A> ... BUT you 
realized that you hadn't eaten anything for the past 24 hours and you begin 
wondering if it was possible to <A 
href="hungry.htm">hunt</A> down a rabbit or 
something to roast. <BGSOUND src="" loop=infinite><!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE --></OBJECT></LAYER>
